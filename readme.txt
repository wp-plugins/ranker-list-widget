Use Ranker to create a custom "ranking poll" - a list your visitors shape by voting, creating engaging, crowdsourced content.


== Description ==

Use Ranker's free widget to create a fully-customizable "ranking poll" - a list about anything that your visitors impact by voting items up and down, creating lasting, engaging content. 

The plugin comes with a built in shortcode generator, you only need the URL of the list on Ranker, we'll do the rest. Setup defaults for your site including colors, fonts, size and layout.

= How it works =
1. Find a list you want to embed from the Ranker.com site. 
2. Copy the URL 
3. Enter that URL into Settings->Ranker Options->Shortcodes
4. Put that shortcode into any post. 

Multiple shortcodes can be used per post.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'rnkr-wp' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Place generated short codes in your posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a short code for my posts? =

That's easy! Once the plugin is installed head to the settings page and switch to the 'short codes' tab. Now find the list you want to embed on [Ranker.com](http://Ranker.com/ "List the universe"), copy it's full URL (I.E. http://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/my-favorite-cartoons-of-all-time) and paste that into the input on the shortcodes page. We do some magic and then the usable short code for that list will be displayed below.

= Why do I have to rebuild short codes when some settings change? =

With the Ranker widget we've tried to be as flexible as possible for site creators. Because of this you can put our widget in any size layout with your choice of rows, our code will recalculate your widget to look just right based on those settings.

Once you have working shortcodes in your pages changing some default settings then requires you to recalculate those codes. Changing width, rows to display or display of username will change the height of your widget and that may leave the CSS a little messy in existing widgets. Recalculating those URLs will help to keep everything looking tip-top!

= Are there any tips to building a Ranker List or Widget? =

= Wait a minute, what is Ranker, I've never heard of this service? =
Ranker has millions of items in its database - everything from universities to comic book heroes to candy brands to your favorite band's discography. To make a list, all you have to do is tell us the topic and pick the items you want to include. Ranker takes care of the rest. Once you've built your own lists, we give you the tools to share them with your friends, or to open them up for voting and let the community decide the rankings!
